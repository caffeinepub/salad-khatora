  "summary": "The diff addresses all four requirements by implementing authentication state stabilization and redirect loop prevention mechanisms. App.tsx uses refs to prevent repeated redirects, Layout.tsx removes navigate from useEffect dependencies and uses refs to track redirect state, preventing infinite re-render loops. The changes directly target the flickering/reloading issues described in the BuildRequest.",
