  "summary": "The diff shows a comprehensive redesign of the LoginPage component that matches all requirements from REQ-46 and REQ-47. The implementation includes the visual mockup design (centered card, Welcome Back heading, Salad Khatora subtitle, email/password fields with icons, green Sign In button, sign up and back to home links) while maintaining Internet Identity authentication. All acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied.",
