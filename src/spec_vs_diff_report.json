  "summary": "The diff shows a LoginPage.tsx that has been modified but does NOT match the Version 10 restoration requirement. Instead of removing the Version 11 card layout features (centered card, 'Welcome Back' heading, subtitle, email/password inputs, 'Sign In' button, 'Don't have an account?' link, 'Back to Home' link), the implementation still contains centered layout elements ('min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center'), 'Salad Khatora' heading, 'Sign in to access your account' subtitle, and a styled Button component. This appears to be a simplified version but not a reversion to Version 10 as specified. The requirement explicitly asked to 'restore the previous login interface implementation that was present before Version 11', but without access to the actual Version 10 code, the diff does not provide evidence that the old implementation was restored.",

Sign up' link, and 'Back to Home' link. Restore the previous login interface implementation that was present before Version 11.",
      "reason": "The modified LoginPage.tsx still contains centered layout styling ('min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-background'), a heading ('Salad Khatora'), a subtitle ('Sign in to access your account'), and a styled Button component. While email/password fields were removed, the implementation does not demonstrate restoration of the actual Version 10 code. The requirement was to revert to Version 10, not to create a new simplified version. Without evidence that the Version 10 implementation was restored, this requirement appears incomplete.",
