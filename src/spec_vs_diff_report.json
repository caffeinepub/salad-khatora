  "summary": "The diff implements authentication enforcement across the application with Internet Identity integration. App.tsx now wraps protected routes with a ProtectedRoute component that checks authentication and redirects to /login. The Layout component includes a useEffect hook to redirect unauthenticated users. A comprehensive README.md was added with detailed Internet Identity authentication instructions. All three requirements are addressed.",
