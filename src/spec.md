# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the LoginPage component to its Version 10 state.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the Version 11 centered card layout from LoginPage
- Remove the 'Welcome Back' heading, subtitle, email/password input fields with icons, green 'Sign In' button, and account links
- Restore the Version 10 login interface implementation
- Preserve Internet Identity authentication functionality

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see and interact with the previous Version 10 login interface while maintaining the ability to authenticate successfully using Internet Identity.
