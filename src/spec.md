# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix admin panel issues in inventory stock status filtering, stock-in ingredient input, product list display, and customer creation.

**Planned changes:**
- Filter Stock Status view to show only ingredients with quantity > 0 and highlight low stock items
- Fix ingredient name input field in Stock In form to allow typing and selection
- Ensure newly added bowl products appear immediately in the product list
- Resolve "Failed to add customer" error and fix customer creation flow

**User-visible outcome:** Admin users can view accurate stock status with low stock warnings, successfully add stock entries by typing ingredient names, see newly created products in the list immediately, and add new customers without errors.
