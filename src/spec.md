# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix logo loading issue in navigation header and implement edit/delete functionality for products in the products tab.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix logo image (logo.dim_256x256.png) not loading in navigation header by verifying image path and file existence
- Add edit functionality for products allowing modification of name, type, price, and availability status
- Add delete functionality for products with confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion

**User-visible outcome:** The logo displays correctly in the navigation header, and users can edit or delete products directly from the products tab with intuitive dialogs and confirmation prompts.
