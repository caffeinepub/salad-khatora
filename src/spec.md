## Summary
**Goal:** Update the admin panel login page UI to match the new design mockup while maintaining existing Internet Identity authentication functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign LoginPage component with centered card layout featuring Salad Khatora logo
- Add "Admin Panel Login" heading and "Secure authentication for administrative access" subtitle
- Display three feature sections with icons: Secure Authentication (shield), No Passwords (lock), and Biometric Support (fingerprint)
- Add disclaimer text at bottom: "By logging in, you agree to use this admin panel responsibly"
- Ensure responsive design for mobile devices
- Maintain existing Internet Identity authentication integration and redirect flow

**User-visible outcome:** Admins see a modernized, professional login page with clear feature descriptions while logging in seamlessly with Internet Identity.
